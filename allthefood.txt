Name: HAMPEASNOODLES

Ingredients:

3 cloves garlic
2 medium onions (I like sweet onions)
1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves or 2 tsp dried (can be less, even half as much)
1/4 cup parsley, (again, less is okay)
3 medium carrots
1/2 pound smoked ham, chopped into squares (you can buy the ham steaks.  Check to see if it's precooked or uncooked.  If the latter, follow instructions for cooking BEFORE you assemble the dish)
3/4 pound noodles (we use farfalle)
oil and/or butter for cooking
2 tsp oregano (i use less, maybe half)
1 and 1/2 cup frozen peas

Instructions:
Heat water for the pasta.

Mince the garlic, chop the onions coarsely, and mince the parsley, basil, and oregano.  Set them all aside.
Peel the carrots and cut them into thin slices.  (I like to cut them on an angle, I think they taste better that way)
PUt the pasta on to cook.
Heat a pan, heat some butter, saute the garlic and onions in the butter until the onion begins to brown.  Add a little more butter and a little olive oil along with the carrots and herbs.  Cook until the carrots are almost tender.
Add in the peas and cook them until the peas are heated through.  
Add the ham and noodles.
Drain the pasta and add it to the rest.

Name: Standard stir-fry sauce
Ingredients:
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon Mirin (chinese rice wine, golden color liquid in a small bottle)
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons sesame oil

Instructions:
Put on some rice and chop whatever vegetables you want in the stir fry.  Heat some oil pretty hot and fry them in reverse order by how long they take to cook.  Carrots, broccoli, string beans take about the same amount of time (?10 minutes? I don't watch the clock, I watch the veggies), then zucchini, onions, mushrooms, and cabbage/bok choy take a little less time.  Some people like to fry up the mushrooms first and then take them out and add them in at the end.  That's more trouble.  ADd the sauce and pre-cooked meat (chicken or pork) or tofu or nuts at the very end.  If you have uncooked meat to put in, saute that first of all, then remove and add in at the very end.

Name: French onion soup 

Ingredients:
5 cups thinly sliced onions (don't use red ones, it says)
6 tablespoons butter (hmm, you can substitute some olive oil and I doubt you need 6 tb worth of any fat)
1 quart stock or water (can use chicken stock but store bought vegetable stock is not recommended)
1 tablespoon tamari soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
a dash of dry thyme
salt to taste
optional: 1/2 teaspoon honey

Instructions:
Mom: (Moosewood version.  I put down the full recipe here but I usually only make half of it. It is good leftover, also I think it could be frozen).  This is easy and takes almost no ingredients but it does take time.  Once the onions are browned, though, you can pretty much leave it for a bit.

Cook the onions, lightly salted, in a kettle.  Cook them until very brown but not burning.  Add mustard and thyme.  Add the other ingredients.  Cook slowly, covered, for at least 1/2 hour.  Taste before serving; depending on what kind of broth you use it may need some salt.  
CROUTONS: It's not too hard to make croutons.  Cut up bread into cubes, put in a bowl. In a cup mix 1/8 cup olive oil, 2-3 shakes of garlic powder, 1-2 shakes of garlic salt, and if wanted a pinch of powdered sage or thyme.  Whisk the ingredients together and drizzle over the bread cubes, covering as evenly as possible.  Toast for 15 minutes in a 325 degree oven.

Name: Vegetable Fried Noodles
 

 (From Mark Bittman, The Food Matters Cook Book, page 208-9.  This tasted good and was fairly quick and easy to prepare.
Ingredients:

8 ounces noodles: he recommends rice, soba, or wheat.  I used Banh Pho noodles size M (flat rice noodles)
1 Tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons vegetable oil (I used corn)
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 cup chopped scallions
vegetables: whatever's in season, including carrots, bok choy, snow peas, green beans, zucchini
1/2 cup stock or water (I used water)
2 Tablespoons soy sauce
1 egg, beaten
Black pepper
1/2 cup chopped peanuts

Instructions:
 1.  Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt it.  Cook the noodles according to package instructions.  Drain the noodles and quickly rinse in cold running water.  Toss with the sesame oil to keep them from sticking.
2. Heat the vegetable oil to medium high.  Add garlic, ginger, and scallions.  Cook about 15 seconds.  Add the other vegetables and turn heat up; cook till the vegetables are tender.  (I started with the green beans and added in bok choy and snow peas and zucchini a bit later.) If the water gets low, add a little more.
3. Stir in the soy sauce and beaten egg; let the egg scramble.
4. Add the noodles, sprinkle with pepper if you want.
5. Mix it all up and serve, topped with peanuts or with the peanuts on the side.
This can be a non vegetarian meal if you add a little pork at Step 2, stir-frying after the garlic/ginger and before the veggies,  removing from the pan then returning it to pan with the noodles.

Name: Chile-lime chicken sauteed with zucchini

Ingredients:
From Andrea Chesman, Serving Up the Harvest, page 178-9.  Another pretty easy stove-top dish.

4 medium zucchini or yellow summer squash (I used one foot-long zucchini for two people with 1 leftover serving)
1 pound skinless boneless chicken breasts cut into thin strips
Juice of 1 large lime (3 tablespoons. I found that one small lime made almost that much juice. Or just use one of those little squeezer things)
2-4 teaspoons minced chipotle chile en adobo.  (We bought a jar of "Casa Fiesta Chiles en adobo sauce" and used 2 peppers' worth along  with some of the sauce it's packed in.  You have to take the pepper out and cut it up.  I'm sure there are other brands.  It was probably a "mild" on the spicy spectrum but it was noticeable)
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 ripe tomatoes
1 green or red bell pepper. (I used a big one)
4 scallions, chopped
chopped fresh cilantro (it calls for 1/4 cup but I just cut some from a plant and didn't keep track)
1 garlic clove, minced
flour or corn tortillas OR rice, cooked

Instructions:
1. Combine squash and maybe 1 teaspoon salt in a colander.  toss, set aside to drain for about a half hour.
2. While the squash drains, combine chicken, lime juice (it says in a nonreactive bowl), and chile sauce.  SEt aside to marinate.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil, saute garlic and scallions for a short while, until scallions are not quite translucent.
4. ADd the chicken/marinade, saute until the chicken's no longer pink.  REMOVE CHICKEN AND JUICE, SET ASIDE
5. Blot the squash with a towel, add oil to skillet, stir fry the vegetables together.  I did the zucchini and pepper all together.
6. REturn the chicken to the skillet.  Add tomatoes and cilantro, turn the heat down if necessary, and let the tomatoes warm up.
7. SErve with tortillas kind of like a fajita, or over rice.  (we had it with rice, then Dad had some leftover in a pita.  It was good both ways.)

Go light the coals if you haven't.  This may take more than one try, but only on wet days.  Set the meat in the marinade and flip it so that it is covered.  
When the coals are lit, pour them slowly into the grill.  They may fall out the bottom or the top, so keep the chimney's lowermost opening inside the grill at all times.
Spread the coals evenly; piles are bad.  
Spread the meat evenly; piles are bad.  
Flip every five to ten minutes; move the pieces around so that they are equally cooked.  
It takes about 30 minutes to finish, depending on the meat's thickness.  For satay, cook just past brown.

Name: Sichuan Fish-Fragrant Eggplant

Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Asian eggplant
2 tablespoons chicken stock, or substitute water
2 tablespoons chili bean paste
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar, or substitute good-quality balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry

1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper
Scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish
Slice each eggplant in half lengthwise, then slice each length into quarters. Cut each quarter in somewhat substantial, but still bite-sized, cubes (about 1 1/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch cubes).

Instructions:
Prepare the sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the chicken stock, chili bean paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, rice wine, sugar, and cornstarch. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until a bead of water sizzles and evaporates on contact. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl the pan to coat the base and sides. Add the eggplants and stir-fry until outsides become golden brown and insides begin to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, and Sichuan peppercorn and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce mixture and mix well. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes to allow the eggplant to full cook and the sauce to thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat, plate, and sprinkle scallions on top.

Name: Chocolate Cake

Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
2 cups whole wheat flour (I am sure white would work but I've never actually made it that way)
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
1/2 cup oil (I use corn oil, I think that's best -- I would not use olive oil)
3/4 cup cocoa (plain, unsweetened)
dash salt
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup hot coffee
1 cup milk

Instructions:
The batter will be pretty thin.  Pour into a 9 X 13 inch pan and bake 25-35 minutes @ 350 degrees.  It is done when a) the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan; or 2) a toothpick poked into the cake comes out more or less clean -- it might have some crumbs on it, but no liquid batter coating the sides.  Your oven may be faster or slower than this.

The cake needs to cool down before you ice it, or the icing will melt away down into the cake.  So you have to try to time it so that your cake will have maybe an hour or more to cool.  (I once forgot about this and ended up with an icing cake.)

Icing
(it is easier to have an electric beater for this, but it wouldn't be impossible to do with an egg beater)
mix together confectioner's sugar and a little butter or margarine and a little milk.  I never do this by measure but I would estimate that I usually use 1/2 to 3/4 of a one-pound box of sugar, 1-2 tablespoons margarine, and 1-2 tablespoons milk.  Dribble the milk in, because it's a pain to have to add more sugar if you overshoot.

Name: Spaghetti with Clam Sauce
Ingredients: 
canned clams
spaghetti 
parmesan
garlic
olive oil 
parsley

Instructions:
Boil water; add noodles.   Peel 2-3 cloves of garlic.
Heat a little oil in a frying pan.  Crush the garlic into the oil and cook
till brown.  Add the contents of the clam can and about another half can of

noodles are getting done.  When noodles are done, drain them.  Serve noodles with sauce on top and add parmesan to taste.

Name: Pancakes
Ingredients:
For a normal amount (two people, ish), use:
Two medium eggs
1.5 cups milk
4 tablespoons corn oil
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
A pinch of salt (optional)

>2 cups mixture of equal parts white and whole-wheat flour


Instructions:
Beat eggs.  Add milk, corn oil, sugar, (salt), and initial 2c of flour.  Put baking powder on top of the flour island, poking it to make sure it doesnÕt clump.  Beat.  It will be too thin, so add flour in small increments until mixture reaches pourable gloppiness.  Add a tiny bit of milk if it goes too far towards solid.

Preheat a thick pan and melt some margarine on the landing pad.  It should melt fast, but without totally freaking out right away.  Pour, leaving room for expansion.  Temperature should be such that pancakes bubble and cave, but not so hot that the bottoms blacken.  After they sit for a few minute, you will be able to poke under them and see the bottoms.

Flip once the bottom side looks like a pancake.  Serve soon after that.  


Name: Fish Fragrant eggplant

1 tablespoon minced ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper
Scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish

Instructions:

Prepare the sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the chicken stock, chili bean paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, rice wine, sugar, and cornstarch. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until a bead of water sizzles and evaporates on contact. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl the pan to coat the base and sides.

Name: Banana Walnut bread

Ingredients
1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for preparing the pan
1 cup sugar
3 very ripe bananas, peeled, and mashed with a fork (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup toasted walnut pieces

instructions
Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl, set aside. Whisk the eggs and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup with a spout, set aside. Lightly brush a 9 by 5 by 3-inch loaf pan with butter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with an electric hand-held mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually pour the egg mixture into the butter while mixing until incorporated. Add the bananas (the mixture will appear to be curdled, so don't worry), and remove the bowl from the mixer.

With a rubber spatula, mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the nuts and transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake for 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Turn the bread out of the pan and let cool completely on the rack. Wrap in plastic wrap. The banana bread is best if served the next day.

We used pre-packaged tilapia fillets.  These vary in weight, but probably average around .25 pound apiece.  Mix the ingredients together in a measuring cup and whisk to blend. Pour the sauce over the fillets.  If you have time, let the fillets marinate for a while, about .5 hour.  
Bake at 375 Fahrenheit for about 15-20 minutes.

Name: Zucchini Boats
Ingredients:
2 zucchini, about 6 or 7 inches long
1 tablespoon butter
1 large shallot, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced 
1 egg
2 tablespoons bread crumbs or 1 1/2 tablespoons flour (see TIPS) 
2 ounces feta, crumbled
Spanish paprika

Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease an ovenproof dish. (See TIPS.)

Instructions:
PREP THE ZUCCHINI Trim the stem end just a bit for aesthetics but leave intact. Halve the zucchini lengthwise. With a small knife, cut around the zucchini, leaving a rim. Cross hatch the center, staying within the outer cut, then scoop out the center with a serrated grapefruit knife or grapefruit spoon. (A small spoon and knife also work, it's do-able but trickier.) Finely chop the centers. 

STUFFING In a small skillet, melt the butter until shimmery. Add the chopped zucchini centers, shallot and garlic and saute gently until soft. Let cool (see TIPS). 

In a small bowl, beat the egg lightly. Stir in the bread crumbs or flour, feta and cooked zucchini. Taste the stuffing, make sure it tastes good (see TIPS). 

FINISH & BAKE Stuff the zucchini boats. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake for 25 minutes to 40 minutes (my time, see TIPS), then brown slightly under the broiler.

Name: West African Peanut Soup
Ingredients:
1 cup roasted and shelled peanuts
1/2 can coconut milk
2 tablespoons peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn
3 onions
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
Pinch of cayenne
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 cups stock or water
3 sweet potatoes or yams (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into thick slices
1 can canned tomatoes
1/4 to 1/2 cup peanut butter, chunky or smooth.

1. Chop peanuts, or crush them with the side of a knife, or pulse them in a food processor to chop roughly.

2. Put oil in a deep skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat; a minute later, add onion, ginger and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken and continue cooking for another 3 or 4 minutes, until just coloring. Add 1/2 cup peanuts and the cayenne and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

3. Stir in the stock and the sweet potatoes, bring to a boil, and turn heat down to medium-low so the soup bubbles gently. Stir in tomatoes, then cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

4. Stir in 1/4 cup peanut butter. Taste, adjust seasoning (you may want to add more peanut butter at this point) and serve, garnished with remaining peanuts.

Name: Red Curry

Ingredients:

1 eggplant
Cubed chicken breast
Zucchini
Tofu
Onions
Green beans or string beans
Garlic
Ginger root
Vegetable oil
Maesri red curry paste (4-5 tablespoons approximately)
Coconut milk (1 can)
Milk (if needed for more liquid)

Instructions:
1. Mince the garlic (as much garlic as you want, within reason), mince the ginger root (not too much ginger root), and cut all the vegetables, but not too small as they will release water when they are cooked. So, 1-inch sized pieces should work well.

2. Heat up large pot, and add approx. 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the garlic once the oil is warm, and cook it to make it brown.

3. Add the whole can of coconut milk at once, and then add the red curry paste. Mix thoroughly to make the mixture homogeneous, and of a brick orange color.

4. Boil the chicken in this stew first, because it will need to cook thoroughly. If you're not using chicken, you can put the vegetables and tofu in once the stew is boiling gently.

5. Once the chicken is cooked somewhat thoroughly, add the vegetables/tofu.

6. By this point, you should have added all of your ingredients. Let them cook for a while with the lid on. Check that the liquid level is high enough such that everything is covered with the sauce. Once the vegetables are tender but not soggy, the curry is done and can be served. Ballin'

Name: TOMATO BASED LEEK SOUP

Ingredients:
15.5 ounce can of cannellini beans (1)
16 oz can Italian style stewed tomatoes (1), pureed  (I think you can buy pureed tomatoes, or maybe at least diced if you don't want to bother with that extra step).  Italian style is important; plain stewed tomatoes are much less tasty.
2 leeks
1 sweet onion (big)
1 bay leaf
3 cups water or stock
thyme (sprinkle)
 
 Instructions:

Chop leeks, make little thin circles.  Only use the white to pale green part.  They may need to be cleaned between the layers.  Chop the onions semi fine..  Saute them in a good sized soup pot using butter and/or olive oil.  When the onions have begun to brown, add thyme, bay leaf, ground black pepper (a little).  Then add the pureed tomatoes.  Simmer covered 10 minutes.  Add beans.  Add water.  Simmer 10 more minutes.  You can add a little ham for flavor if you have it.

Heat up until the whole thing starts to bubble gently.  Add the raw chicken.  Reduce heat to just below bubbling.  Cook until the chicken is done, 15-20 minutes.  i like this method because the chicken doesn't get too done and tough.

Name: kiffles

Ingredients:
1/2 lb butter (use real) (let stand awhile at room temp to soften a bit)
8 oz cream cheese
3 cups flour
Confectioners' sugar, about 1/2 cup, maybe less

(I think you can adjust proportions if you don't have 8 oz of cream cheese)

Instructions:
Mix butter and cream cheese until they're all mixed and a smooth texture. (Grandma's term is "cream").
Add flour and mix thoroughly.
*Pinch dough into balls about one inch in diameter. Chill a few hours.
Prepare rolling-out surface by sprinkling confectioners' sugar on it. (You may want to rub some on the rolling pin too.)

Roll out. Fill with jam or nut filling (see below). Fold into half moons and crimp edges together. Cover baking sheet w/ aluminum foil to foil overflow.  Bake @ 350 for 20-25 min or till golden.  Roll warm kiffles in conf. sugar.
Devour.

Nut filling:
Chopped walnuts
1/4 cup sugar (regular)
1 egg white

Beat egg white till foamy; add nuts and sugar

*I  recall that sometimes we chill the  dough before making the balls. It may save some time.

Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in the applesauce and vanilla. Whisk in the flour mixture into batches, alternating with the buttermilk. Whisk just until combined. Gently stir in the apple chunks. Pour the batter into the prepared muffin pan and sprinkle with the pecan mixture. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 20 min. or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of one of the muffins comes out clean. Let them cool on a wire rack for 15 min. Then run a knife around the muffins to loosen them and unmold them. Cool them completely on the rack. But actually eat them hot.
